# Key Takeaways

1. Same Concept, Different Denominator
   BTC-denominated perps follow the same core mechanics as any perp: funding rates, margin calls, etc., but the reference currency is BTC instead of USD.

2. Two-Dimensional Volatility
   With BTC as your margin and the assets quoted against BTC, your risk profile is more complex. You're watching both how the underlying asset moves in USD and how BTC moves in USD.

3. Extra Hedging Steps
   To manage your net exposure, you may want to run additional hedges if your primary goal is a certain risk profile in USD. Or you can embrace the volatility if you want maximum "spice."

4. Huge Potential (and Risk) for Gains
   If you're correct on your ratio calls (e.g., that BTC will outperform gold, or that QQQ will underperform BTC), you could stack serious sats. If you're wrong, you could see your BTC stash shrink.
