# Enter the BTC-Denominated Perpetual Futures

1. Two Risky Assets, One Trade

When you move to something like SPX/BTC, you're effectively measuring the S&P 500 Index in bitcoins. If you go long SPX/BTC, you're betting the S&P 500 will outperform BTC. But here's the catch:

- SPX is risky (it goes up or down in USD terms).
- BTC is also risky (it fluctuates in USD terms).

So you've got two moving targets, and you're trading the ratio between them. In other words, you're looking at how many BTC one "unit" of SPX is worth.

Price Quote in BTC Terms

For instance, with an SPX/BTC contract, we look at how many BTC one "unit" of SPX is worth. If SPX is 4,000 (in USD) and BTC is 40,000 (in USD), that implies SPX is 0.1 BTC. That's our main ratio to track:

SPX/BTC = SPX (USD) / BTC(USD Price)

2. Collateral in BTC

On top of that, your margin/collateral is also in BTC. This means:

- If you win on your SPX/BTC position, you get more BTC in your account.
- If you lose, you lose some of your BTC.

This can introduce extra volatility in your overall portfolio because BTC's USD value can swing significantly, even if you're not directly trading BTC/USD.

3. Settlement in BTC

Settlements or PnL payments happen in BTC as well. That means your final payout is measured in BTC, not USD. This might sound obvious, but psychologically it's a big shift if you're used to counting your net worth in dollars.
