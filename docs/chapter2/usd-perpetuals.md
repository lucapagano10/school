# A Quick Recap of "Normal" USD-Denominated Perpetual Futures

First, let's jog our memory with how these perps look in the standard market. In "normal" USD-based perpetual futures:

1. Margin and Collateral

When you trade a "normal" perpetual future (say, BTC/USD), your collateral or margin is in USD. Essentially, you fund your position in dollars, and your profits and losses (PnL) are measured in USD.

2. Price Movement and Risk

When you're long on a USD-denominated future, you're betting the asset's USD price will go up. If it does, you score; if it doesn't, you lose.

The key is: there's one major risk factor here, the price change of the asset in USD. So there is one volatility asset, which is the one your going long or short.

3. Settlements

In many classic crypto futures exchanges (for BTC or ETH), even if the underlying currency is USD, you might see settlements in USD-pegged stablecoins (like USDT). But conceptually, it's still a single risk scenario: your net outcome depends on the difference between your entry and exit prices in USD terms.

That's the traditional layout. Simple and straightforward, now let's level up.
