# Practical Implications for Roxtars

1. Risk Management
   - Traditional futures: Manage risk by watching the single asset's price vs. USD.
   - BTC-denominated futures: You need to watch both the underlying asset's moves and BTC's fluctuations.

2. Complex Hedging
   - You might think you're hedging your SPX risk, but now you've also got exposure to BTC.
   - So lets say you want to hedge a long on the SPX/BTC, what you should do is not only short in the traditional market SPX futures (ES1), but also long BTC/USD in an exchange to keep your BTC stash's USD value "locked in."

3. Diversification
   - BTC-denominated products can open the door to more nuanced trading. You're essentially trading spreads (like SPX vs. BTC). This can be super interesting for pairs trading enthusiasts or advanced hedgers.

4. Profit/Loss in BTC
   - When you win, you stack more sats.
   - When you lose, your BTC balance drops.
   - This means your personal PnL is measured in BTC or sats, not in the ol' US dollar.
