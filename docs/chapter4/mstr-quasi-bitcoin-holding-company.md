# MSTR: The Quasi-Bitcoin Holding Company

## Background

* Once upon a time, MicroStrategy was a straightforward enterprise software and analytics firm.
* In 2020, the company's CEO (Michael Saylor) steered their treasury into Bitcoin, going all-in on the "hardest asset" narrative.
* Fast forward to today: MSTR has become a kind of **leveraged bet** on BTC. The software side still exists, but the real story is the pile of Bitcoin MSTR now holds.

## Why Does That Matter to Us as BTC-Denominated Investors?

* If you're bullish on BTC but want a **potentially amplified** way to play that upside (and you're okay with extra risk), MSTR can be interesting because their share price tends to move **2xâ€“2.7x** for every 1% move in BTC.
* This "high beta to Bitcoin" means when Bitcoin pumps, MSTR often pumps **harder**. However, it also means if BTC tanks, MSTR might go **down faster**.
