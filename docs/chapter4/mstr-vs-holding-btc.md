# Comparing MSTR vs. Just Holding BTC

| Factor | MSTR | Holding BTC Directly | Bitcoin ETF |
|--------|------|----------------------|-------------|
| Leverage | Amplified exposure via NAV premium & share issuances | Pure 1:1 BTC | Usually 1:1 to BTC (minimal leverage) |
| Venue | Trades on NASDAQ as an equity (SEC-regulated) | Self-custody or via a crypto exchange (personal) | Regulated ETF structure |
| Expenses | Business ops & overhead | Minimal (custodial or on-chain fees) | Management fees (<1% typically) |
| Upside | Higher beta if BTC surges; can compound over time | Matches BTC price changes 1:1 | Tracks BTC price with small spread |
| Dilution Risk | Yes, but can be offset by more BTC purchases | N/A | N/A (though creation/redemption can affect price slightly) |

## Key Takeaway

* If BTC goes **up**, MSTR might multiply those gains for shareholders.
* If BTC goes **down**, you feel **more pain** than if you had just HODLed coins.
* **Choose your fighter.** Some folks want the raw simplicity of holding BTC; others like the potential upside of a leveraged equity.
