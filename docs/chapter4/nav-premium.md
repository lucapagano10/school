# The Magic Ingredient: NAV Premium

The **Net Asset Value (NAV)** of MicroStrategy can be roughly thought of as:

MSTR's BTC Holdings+Value of the Operating Software Business–Any Debt

Then we compare that to the company's market cap or share price.

**MSTR's share price often trades at a premium** to just the per-share value of the BTC it holds. Sometimes you'll see it trade 1.2x–1.7x (or even more) above the value of those coins. That difference is the **NAV premium**.

## Why Does This Premium Exist?

1. **Leveraged Exposure**

   Investors looking for "BTC in equity form" will bid up MSTR as a quicker or regulated approach, creating a premium over the raw BTC holdings.

2. **Share Issuances**

   MSTR has repeatedly raised capital (via equity or convertible bonds) **at or above** this premium. Then they buy more BTC with the proceeds. In a bullish environment, they might snag **more** BTC per share than they dilute. It's like a self-reinforcing cycle... if the market **keeps** believing in the strategy.

3. **MSTR's Core Business**

   The old-school software analytics side is still active—giving at least some fundamental floor in addition to the BTC pile.
