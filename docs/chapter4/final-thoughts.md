# Final Thoughts

MicroStrategy is a prime example of a company pivoting to become almost entirely about Bitcoin.

* **Upside**: Potentially bigger gains in a rising BTC market, fueled by that NAV premium "flywheel."
* **Downside**: Potentially sharper losses in a downturn, plus vulnerabilities around share dilution and regulation.

That's the trade-off in a nutshell. If you're comfortable with the volatility roller coaster, MSTR can be an exciting alternative to simply holding BTC. For more conservative folks (or those who can't handle the heartbreak of a bigger drawdown), direct BTC or a Bitcoin ETF might feel safer.

## Quick "Homework" Wrap-Up

* **Exercise 1**: Calculate the BTC per share that MSTR **effectively** represents at its latest share count vs. the number of coins on the balance sheet. Then compare that ratio from 1 year ago. Did it go up or down, and why?

* **Exercise 2**: Look at the correlation chart (if you can get the data). How do you see MSTR responding day-to-day vs. BTC's price? Notice the wild swings.

* **Exercise 3**: Brainstorm how you'd evaluate the "fair premium" for MSTR. Is 1.2x of its BTC holdings fair? 1.8x? 2.0x? What influences that?

Remember, all of this is to sharpen your perspective on how BTC-denominated valuations can shift the way you analyze both stocks and crypto-laden balance sheets. Keep that big brain thinking!
