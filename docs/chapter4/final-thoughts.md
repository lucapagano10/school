# Final Thoughts

MicroStrategy is a prime example of a company pivoting to become almost entirely about Bitcoin.

* **Upside**: Potentially bigger gains in a rising BTC market, fueled by that NAV premium "flywheel."
* **Downside**: Potentially sharper losses in a downturn, plus vulnerabilities around share dilution and regulation.

That's the trade-off in a nutshell. If you're comfortable with the volatility roller coaster, MSTR can be an exciting alternative to simply holding BTC. For more conservative folks (or those who can't handle the heartbreak of a bigger drawdown), direct BTC or a Bitcoin ETF might feel safer.
