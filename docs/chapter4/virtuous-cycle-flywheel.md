# The "Virtuous Cycle" Flywheel

### 1. BTC Rallies â†’ MSTR Share Price Usually Rallies More

That higher share price can enlarge MSTR's NAV premium.

### 2. High Share Price = They Raise New Equity

Because the shares are valued richly, MSTR can issue them to the market.

### 3. MSTR Uses That Money to Buy More BTC

Ideally, the newly purchased BTC offsets or **exceeds** the share dilution. Essentially, "1 share out, but 1.2 shares worth of BTC in!"

### 4. Repeat

As long as the BTC bull run continues and the NAV premium stays high, MSTR can keep pulling this trick off. Over time, **each share might represent more and more total BTC** exposure.

TL;DR: If everything aligns (solid market sentiment + bullish BTC), this can supercharge returns compared to just holding BTC directly. But it's definitely a double-edged sword.
