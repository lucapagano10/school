# So…Why might BTC-Maxis care?

If you think in Bitcoin terms, the question boils down to:

> "Does owning MSTR give me more BTC over time than if I had just sat on my BTC?"

Because MSTR's entire approach is to accumulate more coins using the market's premium, in a **bullish** environment, you could end up with more BTC equivalent in your pocket via MSTR shares.

But if the strategy backfires or if BTC's price momentum fizzles for a while, you could lose more BTC-value compared to just HODLing. **Higher risk, higher reward**.

## Key Points to Cover:

- The role of public companies in Bitcoin adoption
- How MicroStrategy serves as a bridge between traditional finance and Bitcoin
- The potential for other companies to follow MicroStrategy's model
- How this approach can accelerate Bitcoin's path to becoming a global reserve asset
- The educational value of MicroStrategy's public Bitcoin advocacy
- Considerations for maximalists who typically only hold Bitcoin directly
