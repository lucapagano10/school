# Risks & Watch-Outs

## 1. BTC Volatility

Since MSTR is basically a **leveraged reflection** of BTC, price swings can be even wilder.

## 2. Regulatory Overhang

Accounting rules, SEC scrutiny, or new crypto regulations could hamper MSTR's strategy or compress that NAV premium.

## 3. Premium Collapse

A major risk is if the market stops awarding MSTR that hefty premium. If confidence vanishes, MSTR could tumble even if BTC is stable.

## 4. Dilution Timed Poorly

If MSTR issues shares at the wrong time (i.e., the stock is undervalued relative to BTC), it hurts existing shareholders more than it helps.

## 5. Competitors

Tesla, Block, or future corporate BTC whales could reduce MSTR's unique "largest corporate BTC holder" brand advantage.
