# Why Look at Companies "Denominated" in BTC?

Traditionally, if you're judging a stock (say Apple or Tesla), you measure its performance in USD. But what if your baseline currency is Bitcoin? Suddenly, you're not just asking "How much USD can I make?" but rather "Is this investment scoring me more BTC than if I had simply held BTC itself?"

MicroStrategy is a prime candidate for this kind of analysis because:

* They hold a **massive** amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheet (over 470k BTC, per the latest data).
* Their share price often moves with—sometimes **faster** than—Bitcoin.

In essence, MSTR offers an **equity ticker for BTC exposure**, plus some quirks we'll explore next.
