# From Grain Markets to Perpetual Realms

Picture this: a bustling 17th-century Japanese port city, wooden stalls lined up along the docks, and traders shouting offers for sacks of freshly harvested rice. Our friendly local farmer, Jaime, has had a tough season, his rice is plentiful, but he's worried that prices might tumble by harvest time. Meanwhile, a traveling merchant, Carlos, fears the opposite: that prices could skyrocket and his profit margins will shrink if he waits too long to buy. They strike a deal today for rice that will be delivered months later, locking in a price that works for both of them.
