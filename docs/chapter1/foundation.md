# Wrapping Up: The Foundation for Roxom Greatness

We've traveled from rice fields in ancient Japan to modern exchanges with beeping charts and futuristic derivatives. Here's your take-home message for Chapter 1:

1. **Futures Evolved From Hedging Needs**: They're not just gambling tools; they were created to manage real-world price uncertainty.

2. **Perpetuals Added a 24/7 Twist**: A unique funding rate mechanism keeps these no-expiry contracts aligned with the spot price.

3. **Open Interest, Funding Rate & Leverage**: Master these three pillars and you'll navigate derivatives with more clarity and confidence.

## Next Steps at the School of Roxom

- **In Chapter 2**: We'll explore the magic of **BTC-denominated derivatives**, why they're the future of traditional finance, and how traditional assets behave on a BTC denominated world.

- **Sneak Peek**: We'll also show you how to read on-chain signals, interpret technical indicators, and play the markets with an edge on next chapters.

## Strap in, Roxom Fam
You've taken your first step into the future of finance and we've all taken a step closer on making it happen. So, keep that sense of wonder and curiosity, and let's rock the next chapter together!
