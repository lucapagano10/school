# Part 1: How Futures Evolved (and Why)

## Introduction

Understanding the evolution of futures markets is crucial to grasping their role in modern finance. This section delves into the key developments and innovations that shaped today's derivatives landscape.

## 1.1 The Classic Futures Contract

### Locking in Prices
Farmers (sellers) and merchants (buyers) agreed on a future price for a good (like rice or corn). This meant the seller avoided disastrous price drops, and the buyer guarded against soaring costs.

### Obligations
The seller must deliver the goods on the agreed date; the buyer must purchase them at the set price.

!!! Key Point: Futures were born out of risk management, not speculation. People needed to protect themselves from wild price swings, long before memes, stonks, and crypto Twitter were a thing.

## 1.2 Financial Futures

Fast-forward to the 19th and 20th centuries. Exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade emerged to standardize contracts. Suddenly, you could trade:

- **Commodities** (gold, oil, wheat, coffee)
- **Currencies** (EUR/USD, JPY/USD)
- **Stock Indexes** (S&P 500, Dow Jones)

### What's new?

- **Expiration & Settlement**: Each contract has an end date, at which it either physically delivers the asset or settles in cash.
- **Speculation & Hedging**: Anyone can participate from hedgers (like airlines hedging fuel prices) to speculators (looking to profit off price changes).

## 1.3 The Crypto Revolution: Perpetual Futures

In the crypto realm, everything moves faster and trades 24/7. So we needed a new flavor of futures that:

1. **Has no expiry**: You can hold onto your positions indefinitely, no rolling over from one contract to another.

2. **Has no delivery**: Since there is nothing to deliver on a pure speculative play, to keep perpetual prices in line with spot prices, traders pay each other periodically depending on which side is more crowded, this is famously called the great funding rate.

!!! This was basically futures on steroids for the speculative minds inside crypto.
