# The Data: A Quick Glimpse

Before you jump in, it helps to know what moves oil. Check out our [OIL DATA ANALYSIS](../trading/oil-data.md) for macro insights. At Roxom, the Index Price is derived from:

1. CME Group WTI Front Month (CL1): The official reference for crude oil.

2. BTC Index: A volume-weighted average of major crypto exchanges, ensuring real-time BTC pricing.

What does that mean in plain English? Roxom calculates multiple reference points for BTC's price, picks the median, and uses it to reduce the risk of random price spikes. It's a mechanism to keep the perpetual futures price close to the real underlying WTI/BTC value.
