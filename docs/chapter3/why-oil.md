# Why Oil... in BTC?

You're probably used to seeing WTI (West Texas Intermediate) priced in dollars per barrel. Flipping to BTC changes the game:

- One-Stop Crypto Portfolio: You can keep your entire commodity speculation within the Bitcoin universe, no need to bounce back to USD or any other fiat.

- Two Volatilities: Oil is volatile (supply/demand shocks, OPEC, geopolitics), BTC is also volatile (macro liquidity, halving cycles, adoption news). Combine the two, and you have a uniquely spicy market that can yield big opportunities, or big risks.

- Accumulate More Sats: The main mindset shift is measuring gains and losses in BTC. If you're bullish on oil relative to BTC, you might increase your BTC holdings if your trade goes right.

Roxom's Twist: Unlike generic OIL/BTC pairs, Roxom's contract tracks the front-month Crude Oil Futures (CL1) from the CME, converting its USD price into BTC via a volume-weighted crypto price feed. That means you're trading OIL referenced index prices, but settling in Bitcoin.
