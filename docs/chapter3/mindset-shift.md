# The Mindset Shift: From USD to BTC Denomination

Most of us are used to oil priced in dollars per barrel, right? Now we measure it in BTC:

- Standard Approach: 1 barrel of oil might cost, say, 70 USD.
- BTC-Denominated Approach: 1 barrel of oil might cost 0.002 BTC (random example).

The difference is massive, mentally and practically. In the crypto world, a typical question is, "If BTC pumps, do I still want to hold oil?" or "Am I gaining more bitcoin or losing it?" That's the pivot: you're no longer only concerned with how much oil is worth in fiat; you care about how many satoshis you're spending or earning.

## Winning the Satoshi Game

- Goal: Accumulate more bitcoin.

- Strategy: If you think oil prices in BTC terms will rise (meaning oil gets more "expensive" relative to BTC), you'd go long OIL/BTC.

- Risk: If BTC skyrockets versus everything else, oil priced in BTC could drop, leaving you with less bitcoin.

This dual-volatility effect is both the charm and the challenge of BTC-denominated derivatives.
