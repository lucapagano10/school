# Strategy Tips

- Keep an Eye on Correlations
   - Oil might spike on supply shocks or OPEC decisions while BTC stays flat, or BTC might pump while oil sits still.

- Respect the Leverage
   - At 10x, a drop from 0.002 to around 0.0019 BTC triggers liquidation. That's not a big move.

- Mind the Funding
   - Even a small percentage can eat into your profits if you hold a position for days or weeks.

- Use Stop-Losses
   - If you don't want to rely on the liquidation engine, place a stop-loss above your official liquidation price for a safer exit.

- Manage Overall BTC Exposure
   - If your wallet is mostly in BTC, you're effectively going "double or nothing" on BTC volatility if you're also using BTC as collateral.
