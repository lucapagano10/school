# Understanding the PnL (Profit and Loss)

You enter at 0.002 BTC per barrel. Suppose it rises to 0.0025 BTC:

1. New Notional

   0.0025 Ã— 5 = 0.0125 BTC

2. Unrealized Profit

   PnL = 0.0125 BTC - 0.01 BTC = 0.0025 BTC

In sat terms, that's 250k sats if 1 BTC = 100 million sats. If you close now, you'd lock in that extra BTC, mission accomplished if you're aiming to stack more satoshis!!
