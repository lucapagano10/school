# Building a Real OIL/BTC Perpetual Futures Position

We've already chatted about perpetual futures, leverage, open interest, and positions in previous chapters. Let's tie it together specifically for OIL/BTC to have a practical view on the concepts:

1. Leverage
   - As always, leverage amplifies gains and losses. But now your collateral is BTC and the underlying asset is oil (priced in BTC).
   - If your oil trade goes the wrong way, you're losing bitcoin. If it goes right, you're stacking sats.

2. Open Interest (OI)
   - Open interest is the total number of open oil contracts (long and short).
   - High OI in OIL/BTC could mean a bunch of BTC "whales" or retail folks are speculating on energy markets via their crypto holdings. That may mean higher volatility, bigger price swings, and more dramatic funding rates.

3. Positions
   - Long OIL/BTC = You expect oil to get pricier in terms of BTC.
   - Short OIL/BTC = You think BTC will outperform oil, making the ratio go down.

4. Funding Rates & Perpetuals
   - Funding rates on OIL/BTC ensure that the futures price tracks closely with the spot price.
   - If a majority of traders are bullish on oil (long OIL/BTC), they pay funding to those who are short, and vice versa.
