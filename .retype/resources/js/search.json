In \"normal\" USD-based perpetual futures:","Margin and Collateral","When you trade a \"normal\" perpetual future (say, BTC/USD), your collateral or margin is in USD. Essentially, you fund your position in dollars, and your profits and losses (PnL) are measured in USD.","Price Movement and Risk","When you're long on a USD-denominated future, you're betting the asset's USD price will go up. If it does, you score; if it doesn't, you lose.","The key is: there's one major risk factor here, the price change of the asset in USD. So there is one volatility asset, which is the one your going long or short.","Settlements","In many classic crypto futures exchanges (for BTC or ETH), even if the underlying currency is USD, you might see settlements in USD-pegged stablecoins (like USDT). But conceptually, it's still a single risk scenario: your net outcome depends on the difference between your entry and exit prices in USD terms.","That's the traditional layout. Simple and straightforward, now let's level up."]}],[{"l":"Enter the BTC-Denominated Perpetual Futures","p":["Two Risky Assets, One Trade","When you move to something like SPX/BTC, you're effectively measuring the S&P 500 Index in bitcoins. If you go long SPX/BTC, you're betting the S&P 500 will outperform BTC. But here's the catch:","SPX is risky (it goes up or down in USD terms).","BTC is also risky (it fluctuates in USD terms).","So you've got two moving targets, and you're trading the ratio between them. In other words, you're looking at how many BTC one \"unit\" of SPX is worth.","Price Quote in BTC Terms","For instance, with an SPX/BTC contract, we look at how many BTC one \"unit\" of SPX is worth. If SPX is 4,000 (in USD) and BTC is 40,000 (in USD), that implies SPX is 0.1 BTC. That's our main ratio to track:","SPX/BTC = SPX (USD) / BTC(USD Price)","Collateral in BTC","On top of that, your margin/collateral is also in BTC. This means:","If you win on your SPX/BTC position, you get more BTC in your account.","If you lose, you lose some of your BTC.","This can introduce extra volatility in your overall portfolio because BTC's USD value can swing significantly, even if you're not directly trading BTC/USD.","Settlement in BTC","Settlements or PnL payments happen in BTC as well. That means your final payout is measured in BTC, not USD. This might sound obvious, but psychologically it's a big shift if you're used to counting your net worth in dollars."]}],[{"i":"why-this-matters-double-volatility-and-more","l":"Why This Matters: Double Volatility and More","p":["Collateral Volatility","In the normal world: If you deposit $10,000 as margin, that generally stays $10,000, ignoring small fluctuations in stablecoins.","In the BTC world: Your 1 BTC margin could be worth $100,000 on Monday, $102,000 on Tuesday, $98,000 on Wednesday... you get the idea. If BTC's value plunges, your margin's USD value also plunges. This can tighten your available margin and potentially trigger margin calls or liquidations more quickly.","Relative Performance Matters With SPX/BTC, you're effectively trading the ratio of SPX to BTC. Even if SPX goes up in USD terms, if BTC pumps more aggressively, you might end up on the losing side of the ratio.","Example:","Let's say SPX jumps +5% in USD terms over a week. Normally, that'd be a sweet profit if you were long.","But if BTC pumps +10% in that same week, the SPX/BTC ratio actually drops, because you now need fewer BTC to buy the same SPX.","If you were long SPX/BTC, you could lose BTC in that scenario, even though SPX's USD price went up.","BTC as the Denominator This single shift (from USD to BTC as the denominator) flips a lot of the usual thinking on its head. For instance, if you short SPX/BTC, you're essentially betting that BTC will outperform SPX, that it'll take fewer BTC to buy 1 SPX unit in the future.","Funding Rates in BTC As with normal perps, there will be a funding rate. But it'll be based on the SPX/BTC ratio. If demand is heavily one-sided (say everyone is short SPX/BTC), the funding rate could get skewed, and those short-sellers would have to pay a premium to the longs, or vice versa. Not only do you have to watch the ratio, you have to watch how the market is leaning in BTC terms."]}],[{"l":"Practical Implications for Roxtars","p":["Risk Management","Traditional futures: Manage risk by watching the single asset's price vs. USD.","BTC-denominated futures: You need to watch both the underlying asset's moves and BTC's fluctuations.","Complex Hedging","You might think you're hedging your SPX risk, but now you've also got exposure to BTC.","So lets say you want to hedge a long on the SPX/BTC, what you should do is not only short in the traditional market SPX futures (ES1), but also long BTC/USD in an exchange to keep your BTC stash's USD value \"locked in.\"","Diversification","BTC-denominated products can open the door to more nuanced trading. You're essentially trading spreads (like SPX vs. BTC). This can be super interesting for pairs trading enthusiasts or advanced hedgers.","Profit/Loss in BTC","When you win, you stack more sats.","When you lose, your BTC balance drops.","This means your personal PnL is measured in BTC or sats, not in the ol' US dollar."]}],[{"l":"Key Takeaways","p":["Same Concept, Different Denominator BTC-denominated perps follow the same core mechanics as any perp: funding rates, margin calls, etc., but the reference currency is BTC instead of USD.","Two-Dimensional Volatility With BTC as your margin and the assets quoted against BTC, your risk profile is more complex. You're watching both how the underlying asset moves in USD and how BTC moves in USD.","Extra Hedging Steps To manage your net exposure, you may want to run additional hedges if your primary goal is a certain risk profile in USD. Or you can embrace the volatility if you want maximum \"spice.\"","Huge Potential (and Risk) for Gains If you're correct on your ratio calls (e.g., that BTC will outperform gold, or that QQQ will underperform BTC), you could stack serious sats.

Suddenly, you're not just asking \"How much USD can I make?\" but rather \"Is this investment scoring me more BTC than if I had simply held BTC itself?\"","MicroStrategy is a prime candidate for this kind of analysis because:","They hold a massive amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheet (over 499k BTC, per the latest data).","Their share price often moves with, sometimes faster than, Bitcoin.","In essence, MSTR offers an equity ticker for BTC exposure, plus some quirks we'll explore next."]}],[{"i":"mstr-the-quasi-bitcoin-holding-company","l":"MSTR: The Quasi-Bitcoin Holding Company"},{"l":"Background","p":["Once upon a time, MicroStrategy was a straightforward enterprise software and analytics firm.","In 2020, the company's CEO (Michael Saylor) steered their treasury into Bitcoin, going all-in on the \"hardest asset\" narrative.","Fast forward to today: MSTR has become a kind of leveraged bet on BTC.

Why Does a Premium Even Exist?“Leverage” Appeal","MSTR's share price often trades at a premium to just the per-share value of the BTC it holds. Sometimes you'll see it trade 1.2x–1.7x (or even more) above the value of those coins.

Then they buy more BTC with the proceeds. In a bullish environment, they might snag more BTC per share than they dilute.
